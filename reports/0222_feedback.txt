Hi Daniel, Liam, and Cole,

Your proposal looks fun! I think you've chosen an interesting scene to target and you'll learn a bunch of cool stuff along the way. 
I think your proposal is pretty solid, so you don't need to submit a revision. A few comments:

One thing that jumped out at me was the flame for the rocket - this sounds like a nontrivial task, since 
typically things like fire are simulated using particle systems. 
Make sure you budget enough time to learn about particle systems and get something implemented for that.

I think using a skybox is a good first step. You could also imagine using some method for procedurally generating randomly 
placed stars in the scene so the ship can fly through space with stars continuously going by without ever "running out". 
Something like this, perhaps combined with some tricks using shaders, should make shimmering stars a possibility - I think that'd 
be a really cool effect. You could also imagine extending this to dynamically generating planets 
(e.g., every so often generate a new planet with a randomly choose size, position, and texture).

I think the animation component may actually be easier than you're thinking - at its most basic, you'll just have a time-varying 
camera matrix and time-varying model matrix for the rocket that has a translation component that changes in order to move the rocket 
and camera through the scene at some velocity. If you're going with the infinite-flying idea I discussed above, it'd probably make sense 
to have the rocket and camera static and let the scene move around it, discarding planets/stars as they move behind the camera.

All that said, I think it makes sense to go for the skybox, rocket-circling-planets idea first then extend from there as time allows.

Follow-up: none - nice job!
Score (proposal): 10/10

Best,
Scott
